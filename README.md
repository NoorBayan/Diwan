## Project Overview

Diwan (ديوان) aims to archive and classify Arabic poetry, serving as a valuable resource for researchers, linguists, and enthusiasts. With data collected from various sources, including web archives, poet websites, and historical books, Diwan offers a structured and searchable dataset that spans multiple eras, countries, and poetic forms.

This project was developed with the following goals:
1. To cover all poems from the beginning of Arabic poetry to the modern era.
2. To classify these poems into detailed categories based on poetic genre, style, language, meter, period, country, and other characteristics.

The dataset can be used for a variety of tasks, including meter identification, automatic poem generation, topic classification, plagiarism detection, and more.
